We propose a permanent distributed record of intellectual effort and associated reputational reward, based on the blockchain that instantiates and democratises educational reputation beyond the academic community. We are undertaking initial trials of a private blockchain or storing educational records, drawing also on our previous research into reputation management for educational systems.}},

doi = {10.3390/publications5030019}, 
abstract = {{Peer review of scholarly papers is seen to be a critical step in the publication of high quality outputs in reputable journals. However, it appears that there are few incentives for researchers to agree to conduct suitable reviews in a timely fashion and in some cases unscrupulous practices are occurring as part of the production of academic research output. Innovations in internet-based technologies mean that there are ways in which some of the challenges can be addressed. In particular, this paper proposes a new currency system using the BlockChain as its basis that provides a number of solutions. Potential benefits and problems of using the technology are discussed in the paper and these will need further investigation should the idea develop further. Ultimately, the currency could be used as an alternative publication metric for authors, institutions and journals.}},

doi = {10.1109/jcdl.2017.7991588}, 
abstract = {{Manuscript submission systems are a central fixture in scholarly publishing. However, with existing systems, researchers must trust that their yet unpublished findings will not prematurely be disseminated due to technical weaknesses and that anonymous peer reviewers or committee members will not plagiarize unpublished content. To address this limitation, we present CryptSubmit - a system that automatically creates a decentralized, tamperproof, and publicly verifiable timestamp for each submitted manuscript by utilizing the blockchain of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin. The publicly accessible and tamperproof infrastructure of the blockchain allows researchers to independently verify the validity of the timestamp associated with their manuscript at the time of submission to a conference or journal. Our system supports researchers in protecting their intellectual property even in the face of vulnerable submission platforms or dishonest peer reviewers. Optionally, the system also generates trusted timestamps for the feedback shared by peer reviewers to increase the traceability of ideas. CryptSubmit integrates these features into the open source conference management system OJS. In the future, the method could be integrated at nearly no overhead cost into other manuscript submission systems, such as EasyChair, Conffool, or Ambra. The introduced method can also improve electronic pre-print services and storage systems for research data.}},

abstract = {{Current Manuscript Review Systems (Conference/Journal) rely on a centralized services (like EasyChair, iChair, HotCRP or EDAS), which manage the whole process that starts with manuscript submissions to notification of the results. As these review systems are centralized, the trust is based on a single entity. The fairness of the system hinges on the honesty of the central controlling authority. This dependency can be avoided by decentralizing the source of the trust. Bitcoin has shown the power of decentralization and shared database through blockchain technology, and currently is being studied for its immense impact on FinTech. We leverage blockchain to address the above concern and present a decentralized manuscript review system that provides trust and fairness. We call this system MaRSChain. As a proof of concept, we develop a prototype of MaRSChain system on top of Hyperledger Fabric platform. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first ever decentralized manuscript review system based on Blockchain.}},

The key to achieve cooperation in blockchain based scholarly communication is to transform today’s static research paper into a modifiable research paper under continuous peer review process.
